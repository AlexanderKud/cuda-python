# What is CUDA Python?

NVIDIA’s CUDA Python provides Cython/Python wrappers for a driver and runtime API for existing toolkits and
libraries to simplify GPU-based accelerated processing. Python is one of the
most popular programming languages for science, engineering, data analytics, and
deep learning applications. However, as an interpreted language, it’s been
considered too slow for high-performance computing.

## Access Python Wrappers for CUDA Driver and Runtime APIs

Unify the Python CUDA ecosystem with a single set of interfaces that provide
full coverage of and access to the CUDA host APIs from Python.

## Accelerate Python Performance with NVIDIA GPUs

Learn how Numba, a Python compiler, helps developers achieve higher performance
from their Python code with GPU acceleration.

# Why CUDA Python?

CUDA Python provides uniform APIs and bindings for inclusion into existing
toolkits and libraries to simplify GPU-based parallel processing for HPC, data
science, and AI.

Numba, a Python compiler from Anaconda that can compile Python code for
execution on CUDA-capable GPUs, provides Python developers with an easy entry
into GPU-accelerated computing and a path for using increasingly sophisticated
CUDA code with a minimum of new syntax and jargon. With CUDA Python and Numba,
you get the best of both worlds: rapid iterative development with Python and the
speed of a compiled language targeting both CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs.

## Ecosystem

Our goal is to help unify the Python CUDA ecosystem with a single standard set
of interfaces, providing full coverage of, and access to, the CUDA host APIs
from Python. We want to provide a foundation for the ecosystem to build on top
of in unison to allow composing different accelerated libraries together to
solve the problems at hand. We also want to lower the barrier to entry for
Python developers to utilize NVIDIA GPUs.
