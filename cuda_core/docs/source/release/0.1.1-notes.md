# `cuda.core` Release notes

Released on Nov <TODO>, 2024

## Hightlights

- Add `StridedMemoryView` and `@args_viewable_as_strided_memory` that provide a concrete
  implementation of DLPack & CUDA Array Interface supports.
- Addition of the Linker class which gives object oriented and pythonic access to the nvJitLink or cuLink API
  depending on your CUDA version.
- Support TCC devices with a default synchronous memory resource to avoid the use of memory pools


## Limitations

- All APIs are currently *experimental* and subject to change without deprecation notice.
  Please kindly share your feedbacks with us so that we can make `cuda.core` better!
- Some LinkerOptions are only available when using a modern version of CUDA. When using CUDA <12, 
  the backend is the cuLink api which supports only a subset of the options that nvjitlink does.
  Further, some options aren't available on CUDA versions <12.6
