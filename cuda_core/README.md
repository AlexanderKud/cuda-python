# `cuda.core`: (experimental) pythonic CUDA module

Currently under active development. To build from source, just do:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-python
$ cd cuda-python/cuda_core  # move to the directory where this README locates
$ pip install .
```
For now `cuda-python` is a required dependency.
